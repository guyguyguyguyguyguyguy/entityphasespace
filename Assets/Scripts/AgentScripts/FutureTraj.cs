        Take current state of sytem and work out the trajectory of the agent for the next n steps, given all other things stay the same

        Compare the size of the 'phase space' given by this trajectory to the whole canvas, if this is different, then emergence has happened -> in the model, the phase space that is different is highlighted


        Need:
            -> State of model at current step
            -> Access to linerenderer of each agent
        
        Possible this should be a model script not an agent script
